<p>Hi there! On a trip to Vorarlberg (most western country of Austria, featuring a people nobody but themselves and the Swiss understand ^^), I had the idea for this song. The recording features Lukas Hartl on the guitar and on the background vocals – enjoy!</p>

<h2 id="lyrics">Lyrics</h2>
<pre><code>Goin' to a distant country
goin' to see you
and I'm a little nervous
'cause I don't know what we'll do.
Will we have good times together
will you see me through?
But I have a good feeling
'cause I'm goin' to see you.

Refrain:
And I have this feeling, oooh
it will be goin' as it should
I have this feeling
that it's goin' to be good.

When you meet me at the train
what shall we then talk?
Perhaps you will offer me
to go out for a walk?
Will you take my hand while walking
or will you look away?
I don't know, but I hope
that it will be good today.

&lt;Refrain&gt;

&lt;Solo&gt;
When I have to leave tomorrow
gettin' on the train
I'm not sad
'cause I know we'll meet again.

And I have this feeling, oooh
it has been goin' as it should
I have this feeling
that it has been really good.</code></pre>
